# MERN Ecommerce Project

A original app, a popular concept.

## Summary

To show how far along I've come with learning, it's time to create a complete e-commerce project with the MERN stack. Mongo, Express, React, and Node are all familiar territory for me, so the challenges with pulling it all together will be refreshing.

## Objectives

- Implement TDD with Jest-Enzyme to ensure a solid codebase with broad test coverage.

- Construct an API using Node and Express that will handle CRUD operations for users and products with our MongoDB database. Users validation will be done with JSON Web Tokens.

- Construct a React client that will provide an interface for users to sign up, log in, view products, and purchase products through our API. This will be a good opportunity to practice React Hooks.

## Todo List

1. Setup

   - ~~Create a new MongoDB database~~
   - Create a baseline server for testing purposes
